    # @brief This function removes potential outliers from a set of paired points.
    #  Two thresholds need to be defined, first a lower R^2 limit to accept the
    #  regression for the RT normalization and second, the lower limit of peptide
    #  coverage. The algorithms then selects candidate outlier peptides and applies
    #  the Chauvenet's criterion on the assumption that the residuals are normal
    #  distributed to determine whether the peptides can be removed. This is done
    #  iteratively until both limits are reached.
    #
    # @return A vector of pairs is returned if the R^2 limit was reached without
    #  reaching the coverage limit. If the limits are reached, an exception is
    #  thrown.
